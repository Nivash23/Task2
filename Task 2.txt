1)Difference between document & windows object
  
  document:
   The Document object represents the entire HTML document within a web page.
   It serves as an interface to manipulate the content and structure of the document dynamically.
   When you interact with the Document object,
   you're essentially working with the HTML elements,
  such as paragraphs, headings, images, forms, and more.

*The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface provided by the Document object.
It allows developers to interact with and modify the content and structure of an HTML document dynamically.
With the DOM, you can create, delete, or modify elements within the document.

* The Document object is at the top of the DOM hierarchy. It serves as the entry point
to access other elements within the document, such as HTML, head, and body.

Windows object:
    
 On the other hand, the Window object represents the browser window or a frame within a window.
It encompasses not only the current document but also other browser-related functionalities.
The Window object acts as the global object for JavaScript in a browser environment.
The Window object is the global object in the browser environment. Variables and functions declared without
a specific scope become properties and methods of the Window object.

* The Window object provides methods to interact with the browser itself,
  such as opening or closing windows, navigating to URLs, and handling alerts.
    
     *windows.close()
     *windows.setTimeOut();
     *windows.clearOut()
